                    GMRGS LICENSE
                       Version 1.0 - May 15, 2025

 Copyright (C) 2025 GoonMaxxingRizzicalGods Society
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

                            Preamble

 The GMRGS License is a permissive code license designed to
 grant users specific rights to use and learn from the code
 while imposing certain restrictions to protect the original
 author's intentions. This License aims to promote learning
 and knowledge sharing while ensuring that the rights of the
 original author are respected.

 The intent of this License is to guarantee your freedom to use
 the code and to learn from it, ensuring that it remains
 accessible for all users. By contrast to many proprietary
 licenses, the GMRGS License is intended to allow you to share
 and learn from the code without restrictions, provided that
 you adhere to the terms outlined herein.

 When we refer to "free code," we are emphasizing freedom,
 not price. The GMRGS License is designed to ensure that you
 have the freedom to use the code (and execute it in any
 manner you wish), that you can read and learn from the code,
 and that you are aware of your rights to do so.

 To protect your rights, we require that you respect the freedoms
 of others when using the code. This means that if you
 distribute copies of the code, whether for free or for a
 fee, you must pass on the same freedoms you received. You must
 ensure that recipients are aware of their rights under this
 License.

 Developers who use the GMRGS License protect your rights with
 two key steps: (1) asserting copyright on the code, and
 (2) offering you this License, which grants you legal
 permission to use and learn from the code.

 For the protection of both developers and users, this License
 clearly states that there is no warranty for the code. It
 also prohibits modifications to the original code, ensuring
 that the original author's vision is preserved.

                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS

  0. Definitions.

  "This License" refers to version 1.0 of the GMRGS License.

  "Copyright" refers to copyright-like laws that apply to other
  kinds of works.

  "The Code" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under
  this License. Each licensee is addressed as "you." "Licensees"
  and "recipients" may be individuals or organizations.

  To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of
  the work in a manner requiring copyright permission, other than
  making an exact copy. The resulting work is called a "modified
  version" of the earlier work.

  A "covered work" means the original Code as well as any
  copies or adaptations that are not modified.

  To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without
  permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for
  infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it
  on a computer or using it for personal learning. Propagation
  includes copying, distribution (with or without modification),
  making available to the public, and other activities as well.

  To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables
  other parties to make or receive copies. Mere interaction with a
  user through a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is
  not conveying.

  1. Grant of License.

  Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person or
  organization obtaining a copy of the Code to use and execute
  the Code in any manner they choose, including for personal,
  educational, or commercial purposes, and to read and learn from
  the code, all subject to the following conditions:

  - Users are not permitted to modify the original code in any
    way. This includes altering the code for personal use or for
    any malicious or ill-intentioned purposes.

  - Users must acknowledge the original author and the License
    under which the code is distributed.

  2. Disclaimer of Warranty.

  THE CODE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,
  EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES
  OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, AND
  NON-INFRINGEMENT. IN NO EVENT SHALL THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS OR
  ANYONE DISTRIBUTING THE CODE BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES OR
  OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT, OR OTHERWISE,
  ARISING FROM, OUT OF, OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE CODE OR
  THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE CODE.

  3. Lim itation of Liability.

  IN NO EVENT SHALL THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO
  DISTRIBUTES THE CODE AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
  INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES
  ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE CODE (INCLUDING BUT NOT
  LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES
  SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE CODE TO OPERATE
  WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN
  ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

  4. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.

  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or run
  a copy of the Code. Ancillary propagation of a covered work occurring
  solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission to receive a
  copy likewise does not require acceptance. However, nothing other than
  this License grants you permission to propagate or use any covered work.
  Therefore, by using or propagating a covered work, you indicate your
  acceptance of this License to do so.

  5. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.

  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically receives
  a license from the original licensors to use and learn from that work,
  subject to this License. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance
  by third parties with this License.

  6. Termination.

  You may not propagate or use a covered work except as expressly provided
  under this License. Any attempt otherwise to propagate or use it is void
  and will automatically terminate your rights under this License. However,
  if you cease all violation of this License, then your license from a
  particular copyright holder is reinstated provisionally, unless and until
  the copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates your license.

  7. Conclusion.

  By using the Code, you agree to comply with the terms and conditions set
  forth in this License. This License represents the entire agreement
  between the parties regarding the Code and supersedes any prior
  agreements or understandings, whether written or oral, relating to the
  subject matter herein.
